## How to Approach ML Problems Step by Step !! 

### Step 1 - Know about the Dataset (01 About the Dataset)
* What Dataset is all about?
* Problem Objective
* Number of Rows and Columns
* Data Stored in which type? Is it a Data-frame or a Dictionary?

### Step 2 - Univariate Analysis (02 Univariate Analysis)
* Uni means one so Single Variable Analysis
* Mainly deals with Numerical Measures used in a dataset (Total 13 Numerical Measures)
* Starts from basic Mean, Median, Mode to Quartile, Percentile, Range, IQR, Boxplot to advance like Variance, Standard Deviation, Covariance, Correlation Coefficient
* Measure Distribution and peakness of data i.e, Skewness and Kurtosis

### Step 3 -
