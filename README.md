## How to Approach ML Problems Step by Step !! 

For THEORY PART, please refer to https://github.com/sandipanpaul21/Machine-Learning-Notes-Daywise

### Step 1 - Know about the Dataset (Refer File - 01)
* What Dataset is all about?
* Problem Objective
* Number of Rows and Columns
* Data Stored is in which type? Is it a Data-frame or a Dictionary?

### Step 2 - Univariate Analysis (Refer File - 02)
* Uni means one, so Single Variable Analysis
* Mainly deals with Numerical Measures used in a dataset (Total 14 Numerical Measures)
* Measure of Central Tendency - 1. Mean, 2. Median, 3. Mode
* Measure of Data Spread - 4. Quartile, 5. Percentile, 6. Range, 7. IQR, 8. Boxplot, 9. Variance, 10. Standard Deviation
* Variation between Variables - 11. Covariance, 12. Correlation Coefficient (Pearson and Spearman)
* Measure Distribution and Peakness - 13. Skewness and 14. Kurtosis

### Step 3 - Bivariate Analysis (Refer File - 03)
* Bi means two, so Two Variable Analysis
* There are majorly two types of Data Variable - Continuous & Categorical Variable
* So 3 possible combinations for Bivariate Analysis
  1. Continuous vs Continuous - Correlation Coefficient 
  2. Categorical vs Categorical - Chi Square Test
  3. Continuous vs Categorical - T Test (n < 30), Z Test (n > 30) and ANOVA Test

### Step 4 - Outlier & Missing Values (Refer File - 04)
* Outlier are data points that differs significantly from other observations
* Techniques to Detect Outliers - 1. Box Plot and 2. Z-Score
* Technqiues to Remove Outliers - Capping Based on Upper and Lower Range
* Missing Values in the Dataset cause concern for Machine Learning Model
* Techniques for Imputing Missing Values
  1. Continuous Data - Median
  2. Categorical Data - Mode
  3. KNN Imputation (why it is better than Median and Mode imputation)

### Step 5 -
