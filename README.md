## How to Approach ML Problems Step by Step !! 

### Step 1 - Know about the Dataset (01 About the Dataset)
* What Dataset is all about?
* Problem Objective
* Number of Rows and Columns
* Data Stored in which type? Is it a Data-frame or a Dictionary?

### Step 2 - Univariate Analysis (02 Univariate Analysis)
* Uni means one so Single Variable Analysis
* Mainly deals with Numerical Measures used in a dataset (Total 14 Numerical Measures)
* Measure of Central Tendency - 1. Mean, 2. Median, 3. Mode
* Measure of Data Spread - 4. Quartile, 5. Percentile, 6. Range, 7. IQR, 8. Boxplot, 9. Variance, 10. Standard Deviation
* Variation between Variables - 11. Covariance, 12. Correlation Coefficient (Pearson and Spearman)
* Measure Distribution and Peakness - 13. Skewness and 14. Kurtosis

### Step 3 -
